# tudoposter
An unofficial beamerposter template and theme for the TU Dortmund.

You will need the Linux Libertine family of fonts.
They are included in TeX-Live or you can download them [here](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/linuxlibertine/linuxlibertine/5.3.0/LinLibertineOTF_5.3.0_2012_07_02.tgz?r=http%3A%2F%2Fsourceforge.net%2Fprojects%2Flinuxlibertine%2Ffiles%2Flinuxlibertine%2F5.3.0%2F&ts=1436002143&use_mirror=vorboss)

The example is made using lualatex, but the style file `beamerthemetudoposter.sty`
is also compatible with pdflatex and xelatex.
